Oh well, that's okay, we presented the website to our parents on October 31st, yes, this was a group project where you had to create a website with someone else, your classmate. But in any way, this is what we ended up with!!",

For this, we had to create a website about a sepcific game or games. I chose- for a series: Five Nights at Freddies, a classic! I'm currently still working on a small re-vamp but I was proud of this work!",

I chose 'March for our Lives' Apart of that, we also had to code out a game. (Unfortunately, I did not complete that assignment, other than completing the starting page and all.) We all had to make our own charity pages seperately and I'm happy how everything turned out in the end.",
